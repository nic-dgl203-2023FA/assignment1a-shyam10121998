          <h3>Bluespruce Ice-cream</h3>
          <p>This is one of my project of Social media, where I worked on marketing strategy. I made calculation of their business performance index on the basis of how much they
            are active on social media and what is their growth. I also worked on the factors which are good for their business and which are not.
            Using all this calculation,I identified their target audience and helped them to grow their business.

          <h3>Brenda's Glass Expression</h3>
          <p> One of the projects in recent times which I worked on was brenda's glass expression. I saw their website which I found inappropriate
            in terms of designing. So , I decided to construct their website. I worked on their content and wireframes. Lastly, I designed their website.

           I created a marketing strategy for this social media initiative. I created their firm performance index based on how frequently and rapidly they use social media. I also looked at the factors that are helpful to their business and those that are not.
            With the use of all this computation, I was able to identify their target market and helped them grow their business.
